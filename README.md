App that Simulates Gravity Between Objects in Space

This is a final project for statics class coded in MathLab 2023a.

The goal of this program is to introduce users to the process of calculating gravitational force between two massive objects in space. It allows users to select two mass values and a distance, which are then applied in the **Gravitational Force Equation** to compute the result.
