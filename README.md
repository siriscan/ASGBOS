## Purpose  
The goal of this program is to introduce users to the process of calculating gravitational force between two massive objects in space. It allows users to select two mass values and a distance, which are then applied in the **Gravitational Force Equation** to compute the result.

## Background: Gravitational Force Equation  

The **Law of Universal Gravitation**, formulated by Isaac Newton, describes the attractive force between two objects with mass. The equation is:  

$`F = G \cdot \frac{M_1 \cdot M_2}{R^2}`$

Where:  
- \(F) = gravitational force (in newtons, N)  
- \(G) = gravitational constant  $`(6.67 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{NÂ·m}^2/\text{kg}^2)`$ 
- \($`M_1`$) = mass of the first object (kg)  
- \($`M_2`$) = mass of the second object (kg)  
- \(R) = distance between the centers of mass of the two objects (m)  

This principle is one of the foundations of physics and explains why planets orbit stars, moons orbit planets, and why every object with mass exerts an attractive pull on every other object.  

## Installation
Like all MATLAB Apps, installation is straightforward. To install, simply click on the ASGBOS.mlappinstall to MATLAB (Perferablly 2023b)

## How to Use
To use, simply use the dropdown menu to choose an astronomical body for Mass 1, input a non-zero number in kg for Mass 2, and input a distance between two center of masses.

**There is a *help* button for more information.**
